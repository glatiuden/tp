## **Introduction**
**Tutor Tracker** is a desktop tuition management application meant for secondary students to track their tuition information, such as upcoming tuition appointments and tutor's contact information.
It focuses on the Command Line Interface (CLI) while providing users with a simple and clean Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Thus, the main interaction with **Tutor Tracker** will be done through commands.

Tutor Tracker is an all-in-one tuition management solution for tech-savvy secondary school students.
The features of Tutor Tracker includes:

- Viewing of tutors' profile
- Adding a note to each tutor's profile
- Exporting tutor's details  
- Adding, editing, deleting and viewing of tuition appointments
- Adding, editing, deleting and viewing of tuition-related schedules
- Filtering tutors by personal preference (i.e. availability, experiences, name, location, price, etc.)
- Adding, editing, deleting and listing grade records in GradeBook
- Adding, editing, deleting and viewing of reminders

The purpose of this Developer Guide is to help you understand the design and implementation of Tutor Tracker to get started on your contributions to Tutor Tracker.

## **Design**
This section will help you learn more about the design and structure of Tutor Tracker. Each section will describe and explains how each component of the application works.
It's noteworthy to mention that the Tutor Tracker follows an Object-Oriented Programming paradigm.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

_Figure 1. Architecture Diagram of Tutor Tracker_


The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

The application consists of 6 main components:

| Component                           | Description
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Main`                              | **`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). <br/>It is responsible for: <li>At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.</li> <li>At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.</li>|
| [**`UI`**](#ui-component)           | The UI of the App.                                                   |
| [**`Logic`**](#logic-component)     | The command executor.                                                |
| [**`Model`**](#model-component)     | Holds the data of the App in memory.                                 |
| [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) | Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.                  |
| [**`Commons`**](#common-classes)    | Represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.|

For each of `UI`, `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage` component, it
* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_appointment 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultBarFooter`, `FilterPanel`, `TutorListPanel` etc. 
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `TutorTrackerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an appointment).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete_appointment 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete appointment_1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : `Model.java`

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the TutorTracker data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<XYZ>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : `Storage.java`

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Tutor Tracker details in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

### [Proposed] Favourite Feature
#### Proposed Implementation
The proposed favourite feature is to facilitate the user to keep track of his/her favourites out of the entire list of tutors. 
It implements the following operations:
* `Favourite tutor` - Add a tutor to the list of favourite tutors.
* `Unfavourite tutor` - Delete the tutor from the list of favourite.
* `List favourites` - Show the list of the favourite tutor.

These operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface by parsing respective `FavouriteCommand`,
`UnfavouriteCommand` and `ListFavouriteCommand`.

Given below are example usage scenarios and how the favourite feature behaves at each step.

### Note Feature
#### Proposed Implementation
Tutor Tracker's Notes feature allows users to create notes that are tagged to specific tutors and export them into a text file.

#### Rationale
As Tutor Tracker is an application to aid users to track their upcoming tuition appointments, we have also considered 
that users may also wish to add notes to specific tutors to keep track of miscellaneous information that the user might have. 
We also considered that the user might want to export details and notes of a tutor into a text file for ease of reference and sharing.

#### Implementation
The proposed note feature is to facilitate the user to keep track of his/her own note of different tutors and export them.
The notes feature consists of the following operations that can be performed on tutors:
* `Add note` - Adds a note to a tutor
* `Delete note` - Deletes the note of a tutor
* `Edit note` - Edits a note of a tutor
* `List note` - List tutor(s) that has a note
* `Export tutor` - Exports the details and attached notes into a text file 

These operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface by parsing respective `AddNoteCommand`,
`DeleteNoteCommand`, `EditNoteCommand`, `ListNoteCommand` and `ExportCommand`.

Given below are example usage scenarios and how the note feature behaves at each step.

When the user enters any of the aforementioned commands, 
the user input command undergoes the same command 
parsing as described in the [Logic component](#logic-component).

To add, delete or edit a `Notes` of a `Tutor`, we use of an `EditTutorDescriptor`. The `EditTutorDescriptor` describes the 
attributes of a tutor to be edited. To add a `Notes` to a `Tutor`, we can simply create an `EditTutorDescriptor` which a 
`Notes` descriptor, and edit the corresponding `Tutor` with this descriptor. The following shows an example of how an
`AddNoteCommand` is executed.

Steps for the execution of the `AddNoteCommand` (assuming that no errors are encountered):
1. When the `execute()` method of the `LogicManager` is called, the `TutorTrackerParser`'s `parseCommand()` method is called.
2. The `TutorTrackerParser` will then create a `AddNoteCommandParser`.
3. The `AddNoteCommandParser` will then parse and validate the inputs, and creates a `AddNoteCommand` with a target index number, 
   and an `EditTutorDescriptor` with a `Notes` descriptor.
4. The `execute()` method of the created `AddNoteCommand` will be called.
5. The `AddNoteCommand` will validate both the index number and the `EditTutorDescriptor` and call the `ModelManager`'s 
   `setTutor()` command which will add a new `Notes` to the existing tutor. 
6. After the new `Notes` has been successfully added to a tutor, it will update the GUI with the new `Notes`, and return
   a `CommandResult` to provide feedback of the command's execution.

![Sequence Diagram of Add Schedule](images/notes/NotesSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Consideration

**Displaying Notes in the GUI**

|              | **Pros**   | **Cons** |
| -------------|-------------| -----|
| **Option 1 (current choice)** <br> Display tutors with attached notes in the same list view. | Allows users to view everything in a single panel. | The tutor panel might look cluttered when the notes are long.|
| **Option 2** <br> Display notes with a pop up when a tutor is selected. | Prevents the GUI from being too cluttered with information. | May impose inconvenience as users would have to select a tutor in order to view their notes |

Reason for choosing option 1:
* We want the user to be able to see their notes easily and having to type in another command to select and show the notes
  in a separate pop up poses too much of an inconvenience.
* The window to display the notes has been made static, and a scrollbar is added when the notes are too long to fit into the
  static window. This can help make the GUI look less cluttered.
  
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the `add_note` command is executed.

![Activity Diagram of Add Schedule](images/notes/NotesActivityDiagram.png)

To export the details and notes of a `Tutor` into a text file, we use the `export` command. The `export` command would
create a new folder `/export` in the root directory. Details and notes of a `Tutor` would be converted into human-readable
text form and exported into the `/export` folder.

### Grade Book
Tutor tracker's Grade Book is to allow users to keep track their grade records for self reference and future study planning.

#### Rationale
As Tutor Tracker is an application to aid users to manage the tutor and tuition information, we have also considered that users
may wish to keep track and manager their academic records for self reference and future study planning. Examples are keeping track
their grades of different tests and different subjects. With Grade Book, users can now store and manage all tuition-related and academic
related information on the same application instead of using multiple applications.

#### Implementation
A grade is composed of a `subject`, `graded item` and `grade letter`, out of which `subject` and `graded item` are used to identify a grade object uniquely. 

All the user's grades are stored internally in the `GradeList`. Grade Book consist of the following operations
that can be performed on the grade:   

* `Add a grade` - Add a grade record to user's `GradeBook`.
* `Delete a grade` - Delete an existing grade record at specified index of the `GradeBook`.
* `Edit a grade` - Edit an existing grade record (changing its attributes' value) at specified index displayed in the `GradeBook`.
* `List all grades` - Display a list of all existing grade records in the `GradeBook`

These operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface by parsing respective `AddGradeCommand`,
`DeleteGradeCommand`, `EditGradeCommand` and `ListGradeCommand`.

When the user enters the `add_grade` command to add a new command, the user input command undergoes
the same command parsing as described in [Logic component](#logic-component).

Steps for the execution of the `AddGradeCommand` (assuming that no errors are encountered):
1. When the `execute()` method of the `LogicManager` is called, the `TutorTracker`'s `parseCommand()` method is called.
2. The `TutorTrackerParser` will then create a `AddGradeCommandParser`.
3. The `AddGradeCommandParser` will then parse the inputs, and creates a `AddGradeCommand`.
4. The `AddGradeCommand` will then validate the parameters and creates a `Grade` object.
5. Assuming that the above steps are all successful, the `LogicManager` will call the `ModelManager`'s `addGrade()`, 
then create a `CommandResult` object and return the result.
6. The `Ui` component will detect this cahnge and update the GUI.
![Sequence Diagram of Add Grade](images/grade/GradeSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Consideration

**Displaying Schedule in the GUI**

|              | **Pros**   | **Cons** |
| -------------|-------------| -----|
| **Option 1** <br> Display grades with budget and reminder in the same list view. | Allows users to view everything in a single panel. | Users may have difficulty to differentiate grades, budget and reminders if a considerable number of them are listed all together.|
| **Option 2 (current choice)** <br> Display grades in a separate tab from budget and reminder in a `Your Information` panel. | Clear segregation between grades, budget and reminder. | May impose inconvenience as users have to switch tabs between grades, budget and reminder depending on their needs |

Reason for choosing option 2:
* As we do not wish to overwhelm the user with too much information to provide a better user experience, we decided that option 2 may be a better option.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the `add_grade` command is executed.

![Activity Diagram of Add Grade](images/grade/GradeActivityDiagram.png)

### [Proposed] Filter Feature
This Filter feature would allow users to manage filters and apply them to the list of tutors
and appointments. This would facilitate filtering of tutors by attributes such as personal
information as well as the subjects they teach, as well as filter appointments by appointment attributes.

The following commands would be added:
* Add filter - Add a new filter to the filter list, updating the visible tutors and appointments
* Delete filter - Delete a filter from the filter list
* Edit filter - Edit a filter from the filter list (including whether it is active)
* List filters - List all filters currently used

#### Proposed Implementation
A new `Filter` class would be implemented, along with a list to store them. Each `Filter` object
would contain predicates that filter the attribute classes, which would be combined and used to
filter the lists of tutors and appointments.

These filters would be shown in the UI along the top of the list of tutors and appointments, showing
the active and inactive filters.

### Schedule Tracker
Tutor Tracker's Schedule Tracker allows users to create schedules to track their ongoing or upcoming timed-sensitive tasks.

#### Rationale
As Tutor Tracker is an application to aid users to track their upcoming tuition appointments, we have also considered that users may also wish to keep track and manage other time-sensitive tuition-related tasks. 
Examples are allocating time to finish their tuition homework or any other tuition-related tasks.
With Schedule Tracker feature, users can now keep track and manage all tuition-related information on the same application instead of using multiple applications.

#### Implementation

A schedule is composed of a `title`, `description`, `schedule date`, `time from` and `time to`, which are used to identify a schedule uniquely.

All the user's schedules are stored internally in the `scheduleList`.
Schedule Tracker consist of the following operations that can be performed on schedule:
* `Add a schedule` - Add a new schedule and store it in the user's `scheduleList`.
* `Delete a schedule` - Delete a schedule by the index displayed in the `scheduleList`.
* `Edit a schedule` - Edit a schedule (changing its attributes' value) by the index displayed in the `scheduleList`. 
* `View schedules` - View the list of schedules that is happening on the queried date.
* `List all schedules` - View all the schedules stored in the `scheduleList`.
 
These operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface by parsing respective `AddScheduleCommand`,
`DeleteScheduleCommand`, `EditScheduleCommand` and `ViewScheduleCommand`.

When the user enters the `add_schedule` command to add a new schedule, the user input command undergoes the same command parsing as described in
[Logic component](#logic-component).

Steps for the execution of the `AddScheduleCommand` (assuming that no errors are encountered):
1. When the `execute()` method of the `LogicManager` is called, the `TutorTrackerParser`'s `parseCommand()` method is called.
2. The `TutorTrackerParser` will then create a `AddScheduleCommandParser`.
3. The `AddScheduleCommandParser` will then parse the inputs, and creates a `AddScheduleCommand`.
4. The `AddScheduleCommand` will then validates the parameters and creates a `Schedule` object.
5. Assuming that the above steps are all successful, the `LogicManager` will call the `ModelManager`'s `addSchedule()`, then create a `CommandResult` object and return the result.
6. The `Ui` component will detect this change and update the GUI.

![Sequence Diagram of Add Schedule](images/schedule/ScheduleSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Consideration

##### Determine the hierarchy of schedule

|              | **Pros**   | **Cons** |
| -------------|-------------| -----|
| **Option 1** <br> Schedule to be a subclass of Appointment. | More ideal in terms of naming convention. | It may cause huge code changes and refactor required due to the Appointment class have already completed. |
| **Option 2 (current choice)** <br> Create an additional parent class to be inherited by Appointment and Schedule. | Less change in codes as the Appointment class was completed (v1.2) before this idea extension proposed in v1.3. | May confuse users with the naming convention if the definitions and examples are not clearly stated. |

Reason for choosing option 2:
* We estimated the number of code changes required, and we deem it to be quite substantial. Hence, we have decided to go for option 2, by creating an abstract parent class called `Event`.

##### Naming of the datetime attribute

After choosing option 2 from the previous consideration, another issue arose due to the separation of classes.

|              | **Pros**   | **Cons** |
| -------------|-------------| -----|
| **Option 1** <br> Rename `AppointmentDateTime` to `EventDateTime` . | More ideal in terms of naming convention. | It may cause huge code changes and refactor required due to the Appointment class have already completed. At the same time, we have other features such as the Appointment Filter, which is heavily build using the `AppointmentDateTime` variable. |
| **Option 2 (current choice)** <br> Retain the `AppointmentDateTime` attribute. | Less change in codes as the Appointment class was completed (v1.2) before this idea extension proposed in v1.3. | May confuse developers with the naming convention if the definitions and examples are not clearly stated. |

Reason for choosing option 2:
* We estimated the number of code changes required, and we deem it to be quite substantial. Hence, we have decided to go for option 2 by retaining the name `AppointmentDateTime` under the `Event` class. We have put comments in the class to explain the rationale behind it.

##### Displaying Schedule in the GUI

|              | **Pros**   | **Cons** |
| -------------|-------------| -----|
| **Option 1** <br> Display schedules with appointments in the same list view. | Allows users to view everything in a single panel. | Users may have difficulty to differentiate appointments and schedule if not looked properly. |
| **Option 2 (current choice)** <br> Display schedules in a separate tab from appointment. | Clear segregation between appointments and schedules. | May impose inconvenience as users have to switch tabs between appointments and schedules depending on their needs. |

Reason for choosing option 2:
* As we do not wish to overwhelm the user with too much information to provide a better user experience, we decided that option 2 may be a better option.
* Viewing appointments and schedules in the same panel is later proposed as a different solution in the Timeable Feature.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the `add_schedule` command is executed.

![Activity Diagram of Add Schedule](images/schedule/ScheduleActivityDiagram.png)

### Reminder Tracker
Tutor Tracker's Reminder Tracker allows users to create reminders to help them track their ongoing or upcoming todos or non-time constraint tasks.

#### Rationale
As Tutor Tracker is an application to aid users to track their upcoming tuition appointments, we have also considered that users may also wish to keep track and manage tuition-related reminders.
Reminders are date but not time-sensitive, users can add as many reminders as they wish on a certain day.

#### Implementation
A reminder is composed of `description` and `date`, which are used to identify a reminder uniquely.

![Class Diagram of Reminder](images/reminder/ReminderClassDiagram.png)

All the user's reminders are stored internally in the `reminderList`.
Reminder Tracker consist of the following operations that can be performed on reminders:
* `Add a reminder` - Add a new reminder and store it in the user's `reminderList`.
* `Delete a reminder` - Delete a reminder by the index displayed in the `reminderList`.
* `Edit a reminder` - Edit a reminder (changing its attributes' value) by the index displayed in the `reminderList`.
* `List all reminders` - View all the reminders stored in the `reminderList`.

These operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface by parsing respective `AddReminderCommand`,
`DeleteReminderCommand` and `EditReminderCommand`.

When the user enters the `add_schedule` command to add a new schedule, the user input command undergoes the same command parsing as described in
[Logic component](#logic-component).

Steps for the execution of the `AddReminderCommand` (assuming that no errors are encountered):
1. When the `execute()` method of the `LogicManager` is called, the `TutorTrackerParser`'s `parseCommand()` method is called.
2. The `TutorTrackerParser` will then create a `AddReminderCommandParser`.
3. The `AddReminderCommandParser` will then parse the inputs, and creates a `AddReminderCommand`.
4. The `AddReminderCommand` will then validates the parameters and creates a `Reminder` object.
5. Assuming that the above steps are all successful, the `LogicManager` will call the `ModelManager`'s `addReminder()`, then create a `CommandResult` object and return the result.
6. The `Ui` component will detect this change and update the GUI.

![Sequence Diagram of Add Reminder](images/reminder/ReminderSequenceDiagram.png)

**Displaying Reminders in the GUI**

|              | **Pros**   | **Cons** |
| -------------|-------------| -----|
| **Option 1** <br> A pop-up notification for reminder of the day. | User are notified of reminders without having specifically request for it. | Multiple pop-up notifications from the reminders could cause annoyance for the user. |
| **Option 2 (current choice)** <br> Display reminders at the side of the main window. | User could see clearly the duration left for each task at a glance. | Reminders can be missed out if users are not aware of it. |

Reason for choosing option 2:
* Pop-up notifications can be intrusive and may cause latency when using the application.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the `add_reminder` command is executed.

![Activity Diagram of Add Reminder](images/reminder/ReminderActivityDiagram.png)

### Timetable Window
Tutor Tracker's Timetable GUI allows users to view their appointments and schedules of a particular week in a graphical representation.

#### Rationale
As Tutor Tracker is an application to aid users in tracking their upcoming tuition appointments and schedules, our target users are secondary students.
Similar to their school's timetable, we wish to present their personal tuition appointments and schedules as a timetable.

#### Implementation
The current implementation of the timetable view retrieve the list of appointments and schedules from the `ModelManager`. 
The timetable view will display appointments and schedules timeslots from Monday to Sunday using JavaFx's GridPane. 
Each row would consist of all appointments & schedules of a specific day.
The duration of an appointment or schedule would correspond to the number of columns. 
The date of an appointment will be indicated using the first column of the grid.

When the user enters the `timetable` command to open the timetable window, the user input command undergoes the same command parsing as described in
[Logic component](#logic-component).

Steps for the execution of the `ViewTimeTableCommand` (assuming that no errors are encountered):
1. When the `execute()` method of the `LogicManager` is called, the `TutorTrackerParser`'s `parseCommand()` method is called.
2. The `TutorTrackerParser` will then create a `ViewTimeTableCommandParser`.
3. The `ViewTimeTableCommandParser` will then parse the inputs, and creates a `ViewTimeTableCommand`.
4. The `ViewTimeTableCommand` will then validates the parameters.
5. Assuming that the above steps are all successful, the `LogicManager` will call the `ModelManager`'s `viewTimetable()`, then create a `CommandResult` object and return the result.
6. The `Ui` component will detect that it is asking for the timetable window, and will open it as a separate window.

![Sequence Diagram of View TimeTable](images/timetable/TimetableWindowSequenceDiagram.png)

**Displaying TimeTable in the GUI**

|              | **Pros**   | **Cons** |
| -------------|-------------| -----|
| **Option 1** <br> A embedded timetable at the side of main window. | Users can view their timetable without having specifically request for it. | UI may be too cluttered due to amount of information on screen. |
| **Option 2 (current choice)** <br> Displaying timetable as a separate window. | Visually cleaner and clearer as it is isolated from the other Tutor Tracker's Main Window. | Lower user experience as commands are required to open the timetable window. |

Reason for choosing option 2:
* To avoid overwhelming users with a huge amount of information, we strongly believe that opening a separate window is ideal.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the `timetable` command is executed.

![Activity Diagram of View TimeTable](images/timetable/TimetableWindowActivityDiagram.png)

### [Proposed] Budget Feature
#### Proposed Implementation
The proposed budget feature is to facilitate the user to keep track of the total
cost of all of his own appointments and whether it is within the budget he has set for
himself. The budget is an optional feature, and can easily be added through
CLI.
It supports the following operations:
#### `command` - example usage
* `add_budget budget_size` - add_budget b/500
* `edit_budget budget_size` - edit_budget b/600
* `delete_budget` - delete_budget
* `view_budget` - view_budget


Given below is example usage scenarios and how the reminder features behave.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

Tech-savvy secondary school students in Singapore who to need to search for tutors, manage their tuition appointments
and academic records, and prefer CLI over GUI.

**Value proposition**:

The demand for tuition in Singapore is escalating, especially among secondary school students. A large amount of time and money has been invested in finding tutors and managing ever growing lists of tuition appointments. Currently, there are limited number of apps and websites that cater to this need, particularly in a streamlined typing oriented CLI. Therefore, this app aims to assist secondary school students in streamlining the process of searching for tutors and managing their tuition appointments. These students can search for an ideal tutor based on their personal preferences (such as subjects, expertise, years of experience, cost, availability etc.), and cut down on the time taken tracking their favoured tutors and tuition appointments.

### User stories
