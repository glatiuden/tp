Hello I’m Kingsley a Year 2 Computer Science student. I’m an aspiring researcher and content creator.

## Project: Tutor Tracker
_**Tutor Tracker**_ is a **desktop app designed to help secondary school students manage tutors and tuition appointments, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) for a fast and streamlined experience while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Tutor Tracker can get your tuition contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented TutorSubject as well as Subject attribute classes.
    * What it does: Represents subjects that a tutor can teach.
    * Justification: Allows user to keep track of subjects that a tutor teaches.
    * Links: [#55](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/pull/55)
    * Credits: Code is adapted from `model` code in AddressBook 3.

* **New Feature**: Implemented parsing for commands to add and edit appointments.
    * What it does: Adds command line parsing for add and edit appointments.
    * Justification: Allows application to recognise commands to add and edit
        appointments.
    * Links: [#94](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/pull/94), [#97](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/pull/97)
    * Credits: Code is adapted from `add` and `edit` parsing code in AddressBook 3.

* **New Feature**: Implemented editing of subject details in tutors.
    * What it does: Allows user to edit the subjects in a tutor.
    * Justification: Allows user to update subject details in a tutor without having
        to delete and re-add the tutor with new subject details.
    * Highlights: Required large addition to parsing and command execution to
        accomodate subject and subject attributes.
    * Links: [#98](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-3/tp/pull/98)
    * Credits: Code is adapted from `edit` code in AddressBook 3.

* **New Feature**: Implemented filtering of tutors.
    * What it does: Allows users to add and delete filters that filters the tutors
        shown.
    * Justification: Allows users to filter through the list of tutors efficiently
        according to their needs.
    * Highlights: Filters for each tutor attribute were implemented and rules were created to
        determine how filters of the same and different types interacted with each other. The
        GUI was also updated to display the active tutor filters to the user.
